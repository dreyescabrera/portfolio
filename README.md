# Hi, I'm Diego! 👋

I love developing web apps and understanding how things work from behind 🔍
## 🚀 About Me
I'm a Web Developer from Venezuela, currently located in Atlanta, USA. 📍

One year ago, I found a passion for developing when I took a course of JavaScript, as I was seeking a purpose that really catches me, facing my ever first algorithms, layouts and so on. Since then, I have been working on mastering my ability of solving user's problems with optimized and clean code within my web apps.
